# ü¶ä e621 Wrapped

This is a Python application for generating overviews of a user's favorite tags in e621 based on public favorite data.

## ‚öô Quickstart

### Requirements

To run this application, you will need to have Python 3.10 installed. It can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Running

You can download this repository by clicking **Download ZIP** on the **Code** dropdown (green button on the top right). Unzip it wherever you want

To generate your e621 Wrapped, simply double click `generate.bat` on **Windows** or run `generate.sh` on **Linux**. This will generate a terminal window that will install the required libraries and ask you for your USER_ID (the numbers that appear at the end of your profile's url). Finally, it will generate the files `username.png`, which contains your e621 Wrapped, and `username_detailed.png`, which contains a more thorough report, with information on the top 25 contenders for each category

### Authentication

If you'd like to access your own private favorite information, you can optionally create a `credentials.json` file in the main directory that contains the following:

```json
{
    "username": "YOUR USER NAME HERE",
    "api_key": "YOUR API KEY HERE",
    "user_agent": "e621Wrapped/1.0 (by mormonara on e621)"
}
```

## üëÄ Recommendation engine

After running `e621_wrapped.py`, the program will generate a profile that will be store as `username_profile.json`. With this, you can run `recommend.bat` on Windows or `recommend.sh` on Linux to search through a selection of tags and extract non-favorited posts that match with your profile. If you have authentication set up, you also have the option to have the program automatically create a private set in your profile and add the recommended posts to it, so you can more easily sort through them

## ‚ùì How it works

e621 Wrapped uses public favorite information to create a user profile and compares it to the average user

### Creating an average user profile

The file `interests.json` stores information about the **presence** of each tag in the average user's favorites. That is, what percentage of posts in their favorites contain this tag. This file was generated from the public favorites of a couple thousand users, starting from e621's top users. You can run `interest_generator.py` with a custom amount of pages using the option `-p total_pages` to regenerate the average user profile, but keep in mind that this will take at least 6 minutes per page due to e621's API's limits.

### Computing a user's profile

When you run `e621_wrapped.py`, a user_profile is generated that, for each tag present in your favorites, computes the values in the following table. This user_profile is used only to generate your Wrapped and is not stored.

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|**presence**|What percentage of your favorite posts contain this tag|
|**relative_presence**|How many times more present this tag is in your favorites than in the average user|
|**enjoyment**|The harmonic mean of **presence** and the (capped at 100 and normalized) **relative presence**. This means that the higher and the more balanced the two other fields are, the higher **enjoyment** be|

Tags are then sorted in order of **enjoyment**. We also use tag implications to consider only the most enjoyed tag from a collection of similar ones. This process uses the tag implication data in `data/tag_implications.csv`, which was downloaded from the [db_export](https://e621.net/db_export/) on 06/30/2025. Feel free to replace it for the newest version. Just make sure to give it the same name.

### Finding posts that match your profile

Posts in your favorites are scored on the 4 major categories presented in the Wrapped in such a way that they are balanced to have similar weight. For each category. For each post, its score...

- Is the sum of the enjoyment (balanced by major category) of each tag it contains
- Gets a penalty based on the amount of tags it has (so as not to favor bloated posts)
- Gets a bonus based on score (so as to favor posts other people have enjoyed)
